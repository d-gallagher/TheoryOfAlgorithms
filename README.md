# TheoryOfAlgorithms - Main Page
###### Lecturer: Ian McLoughlin
This repository is a record of course work during the Theory of Algorithms module.  
An introduction to the theory of algorithms, especially the areas of computation and computability.
#### Learning Outcomes 
* Compare different models of computation.
* Write computer programs using a selection of programming paradigms.
* Analyse the complexity of an algorithm.
* Identify difficult computational problems in everyday programming
    
The [SHA256](https://github.com/d-gallagher/TheoryOfAlgorithms/tree/master/SHA256) directory follows a series of lab work exercises where we learn about SHA256 and write the C code to implement it.  
The [MD5](https://github.com/d-gallagher/TheoryOfAlgorithms/tree/master/MD5) directory is the assignment portion of the module which in which we use [RFC1321- The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1321) to develop our own implementation of MD5 in C, and provide research and resources.
